# What is SwapAssets ?
SwapAssets is a web3 tokenization project - it's goal is to manage (buy/sell/trade/) NFT assets in the blockchain. It can divide on-chain assets into multiple fractions.

## SwapAssets 3D Launcher :
![3D Launcher](Ressources/LauncherSwapAssets.png "SwapAssets Launcher")
With the 3D launcher made with Unity (that can be download in the "SwapAssets-Project" folder), users can connect their wallet with their mobile app wallet, through a QR Code and then start buy, sell and trade assets in the SwapAssets smart contract exchange.

## Smart Contract Exchange
To work, SwapAssets use the blockchain with a smart contract. The smart contract not only act as a traditional exchange, it can actually divide an NFT into multiple fractions, to make the NFT ownable by multiple owners.

## Smart Contract test quality
To ensure the quality of the smart contract, multiple tests has been made with Truffle tool. These tests can be found in the folder "smart-contract-tests".

## SwapAssets users stories
The solution has been created with the help of the agile framework. All the users stories can be found in the folder "users-stories".
